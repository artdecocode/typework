%NPM: typework%

_Typework_ is used to Manage And Vendor JSDoc Types. With the special `/* typework */` keyword, JSDoc type declarations can be moved across JS files, and imported files in types (`import('../types/context')`) will be copied across to the target project.

```sh
yarn add typework
```
